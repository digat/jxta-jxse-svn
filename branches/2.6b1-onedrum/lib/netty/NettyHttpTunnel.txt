NettyHttpTunnel is a stand-alone add-on to the Netty library written by 
Iain McGinniss with the support of OneDrum (www.onedrum.com). It is 
presently a candidate for inclusion in the core Netty distribution,
but is presently being maintained as a separate module as it does not
change any fundamental components on Netty. This is to facilitate
moving to new, API compatible versions of Netty without issue
(particularly important to JXTA at present). The library has been
tested against Netty 3.2.0-BETA1, and the source code can be found
here:

NettyHttpTunnel is released under the Apache 2 license, the same
license that Netty itself uses.
